# VSCode server shutdown

This is a shellscript for automatically shutdown the VSCode server when there is no connection from the client like AWS cloud9.

If the client opens VSCode using a web browser, it will not be shut down. But if the browserï¼ˆthe page where VSCode is open) is closed, the server will be automatically shut down 30 minutes after it is closed.
